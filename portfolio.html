        <h1> Ana Davis</h1>
        <div class="paragraph">
            My name is Ana, a few call me by my middle name
            Cecilia. I was born in Sonora, Mexico. My hometown, San Carlos
            is about 6 hours away from Tucson, and it is great place to visit.
            I grew up in Mexico City, where I met amazing people and visited
            wonderful places. I currently live in the lovely Tucson, AZ. I have
            managed to fall in love with this town, their food, traditions and even
            their weather.
            </p>

            <p> "Familia" and God comes first to me. My husband and three
                kids make me very happy, let's say I am very blessed to have them.
                I am slightly obsessed with sharks and cactus. I enjoy the beach, food,
                art and good music.
