    <h1> Ana Davis</h1>
    <div class="paragraph">
      My name is Ana, a few call me by my middle name, Cecilia. I was born in Sonora, Mexico. My hometown, San Carlos is
      about 6 hours away from Tucson, and it is great place to visit. I grew up in Mexico City, where I met amazing
      people and visited
      wonderful places. I currently live in the lovely Tucson, AZ. I have
      managed to fall in love with this town, their food, traditions and even
      their weather.
      </p>

      <p> "Familia" and God comes first to me. My husband and three
        kids make me very happy, let's say I am very blessed to have them.
        I am slightly obsessed with sharks and cactus. I enjoy the beach, food,
        art and good music.
