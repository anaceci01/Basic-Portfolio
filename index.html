    <h2>Ana C. Davis</h2>

    <p> My name is Ana, a few call me by my middle name 
        Cecilia. I was born in Sonora, Mexico. My hometown, San Carlos
        is about 6 hours away from Tucson, and it is great place to visit.
        I grew up in Mexico City, where I met amazing people and visited 
        wonderful places. I currently live in the lovely Tucson, AZ. I have
        managed to fall in love with this town, their food, traditions and even 
        their weather. 
       </p>

    <p> "Familia" and God comes first to me. My husband and three
        kids make me very happy, let's say I am very blessed to have them.
        I am slightly obsessed with sharks and cactus. I enjoy the beach, food,
        art and good music.
    </p>   

    <p> My favorite place to visit is Hawaii, and if I could, I would live there.</p>
